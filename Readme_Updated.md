1) Install `tidyverse` package and load the dataset

```{r}

#install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)

## Using readr to read csv
df_drug <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/drug-use-by-age/drug-use-by-age.csv')

### Data Transformations
***


2) Let's explore the data type of all the variables of the dataset using `dplyr::glimpse`

```{r}
#View(df_drug)
dplyr::glimpse(df_drug)
```



3) Using the functions provided by the `dplyr` package, select the columns which ends with `use`


```{r}
drug_use <- df_drug %>%
  select(age,n,ends_with("use"))
```


4) View the dataset `drug-use`

```{r}
head(drug_use)
```

5) Now gather the column names as values for a new column `drugUse_name`


```{r}
#drug_use
drug_use<-drug_use%>%
  gather(-age,-n,key = "drugUse_name",value = "drugUse",`alcohol-use`,
`marijuana-use`,
`cocaine-use`,
`crack-use`,
`heroin-use`,
`hallucinogen-use`,
`inhalant-use`,
`pain-releiver-use`,
`oxycontin-use`,
`tranquilizer-use`,
`stimulant-use`,
`meth-use`,
`sedative-use`
)
```


6) Using the functions provided by the `dplyr` package, select the columns which ends with `frequency`


```{r}
drug_freq <- df_drug %>%
  select(age,n,ends_with("frequency"))
head(drug_freq)
```


7) Now gather the column names as values for a new column `drugFreq_name`

```{r}
drug_freq<-drug_freq%>%
  gather(-age,-n,key = "drugFreq_name",value = "drugFreq",`alcohol-frequency`,
`marijuana-frequency`,
`cocaine-frequency`,
`crack-frequency`,
`heroin-frequency`,
`hallucinogen-frequency`,
`inhalant-frequency`,
`pain-releiver-frequency`,
`oxycontin-frequency`,
`tranquilizer-frequency`,
`stimulant-frequency`,
`meth-frequency`,
`sedative-frequency`
)
```


8) Merge the two datasets `drug_use` and `drug_freq` in a single dataframe as `tidy_drug_data` using `full_join()` as a function provided by the `dplyr` package


```{r}
tidy_drug_data <- full_join(drug_use,drug_freq,by=c("age","n"))

head(tidy_drug_data)
```


9) Use `ggplot()` along with `facet_wrap` to individually plot the variation of drugs with age.


```{r}

drugUse_plot <- ggplot(tidy_drug_data,aes(x = age, y = drugUse,color=drugUse_name)) +

  geom_point() +
  
  facet_wrap(~ drugUse_name, nrow = 5) + 
  geom_smooth(color = "black")

drugUse_plot 

```


By plotting the graphs individually for each drug, it gives us a clear picture of which drug usage is higher at particular ages compared to other drugs.


10) Here ggplot() is used to plot the drug use rate varying with age. As we see in the data description,`n` is the number of people survyed for a particular drug. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = tidy_drug_data, 
    mapping = aes(x = age, y = drugUse)) + 
    geom_point(aes(fill = drugUse_name, size = n), shape = 21, color = "white") + 
    geom_smooth(aes(x = age, y = drugUse)) +
    labs(
        x = "Age", 
        y = "Drug use rate", 
        title = "drug use Data",
        subtitle = "ages with drug use rate",
        caption = "Source: ggplot2 package") + 
    scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") + 
    scale_size(range = c(0, 12)) +
    guides(size = guide_legend(override.aes = list(col = "black")), 
           fill = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size = 5))) +
    theme_bw()
```



11)  Using `filter()` function of `dplyr` package of tidyverse to group drugs whose usage is greater than 60%


```{r}

head(tidy_drug_data %>% 
    filter(`drugUse` > 60 ))

```

***
### Conclusion
***

```{r}
ggplot(data = tidy_drug_data, 
    mapping = aes(x = age, y = drugUse)) + 
    geom_point(aes(fill = drugUse_name, size = n), shape = 21, color = "white") + 
    geom_smooth(aes(x = age, y = drugUse)) +
    labs(
        x = "Age", 
        y = "Drug use rate", 
        title = "drug use Data",
        subtitle = "ages with drug use rate",
        caption = "Source: ggplot2 package") + 
    scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") + 
    scale_size(range = c(0, 12)) +
    guides(size = guide_legend(override.aes = list(col = "black")), 
           fill = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size = 5))) +
    theme_bw()
```

As we can see, from the graphs and also from filtering data : 

Alcohol is the most abused drug among the age group of 22-23.

More than 80% Percentage of those in an age group of 22-23 who used alcohol in the past 12 months.
