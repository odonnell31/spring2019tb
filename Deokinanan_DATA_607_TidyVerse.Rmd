#### Overview {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset.-pills}
***

This assignment can be found on [my rpub](http://rpubs.com/greeneyefirefly/data607-tidyverse).

`tidyverse` is a collection of R packages for modeling, transforming and visualizing data. When tidyverse is loaded, these main packages will be loaded `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `readr`, `purrr`, `tibble`, `stringr`, and `forcats`. There are even supporting packages which compliments them. The map below highlights the standard use for a specific package.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="© Tidyverse Package"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://rviews.rstudio.com/post/2017-06-09-What-is-the-tidyverse_files/tidyverse1.png")
```

##### The Task

We process information quickly when it is presented using charts or graphs. Thus, it has become imperative to show complex data and report through graphs and charts. In this assignment, I aim is to demonstrate how tidyverse's `ggplot2` can create basic and advanced visualizations that can capture valuable information, and provide a clear, analytical representation of the data in an easily understandable way. 

###### Minimal focus should be on *hidden* codes.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Main package
library(tidyverse)
# ad-hoc packages for ggplot2
library(ggrepel)  # contains extra geoms
library(ggdendro) # allows for creation of dendrograms and tree plots
```

##### The Data

The data set used in this `tidyverse` exploration is the Audio Features obtained from Spotify API about tracks by the Korean boy band called *SHINee*. There are 9 features which are utilized in this assignment. These include:

* Mood: Danceability, Valence, Energy, Tempo
* Properties: Loudness, Speechiness, Instrumentalness, 
* Context: Liveness, Acousticness

The data was retrieved using the code below and stored onto [my GitHub](https://github.com/greeneyefirefly/Data607/tree/master/Projects/tidyverse):

<details>
  <summary> *Access Spotify API* </summary>
```{r eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
library(spotifyr)
Sys.setenv(SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID = 'Your Client ID')
Sys.setenv(SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET = 'Your Client Secret Key')
artist_name <- c('SHINee')
# Tidyverse: purr::map_df return a data frame
# Tidyverse: dplyr::mutate add new or replace existing columns in a data frame
SHINee_audio_features <- map_df(artist_name, function(artist){
  get_artist_audio_features(artist) %>% mutate(artist_name = artist)})
```
</details>

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
load("SHINee_audio_features.Rda")
library(kableExtra)
kable(as.data.frame(SHINee_audio_features[,-c(24)])) %>%
  kable_styling() %>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "350px")
```

#### Tidy & Transformation {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset.-pills}
***

This data set contains multiple unnecessary columns and duplicated rows, therefore the data was tidied and transformed. Firstly, all character variables are transformed into factors so they can be easily identified and removed. Next, since the band releases song in both Korean and Japanese languages, the data is split into two where the features are averaged for each album. Additional tidying and transformation are performed as the data set is being explored.

```{r}
# Tidyverse: dplyr::mutate_if operate on columns for which a predicate returns TRUE
SHINee_audio_features <- SHINee_audio_features %>% 
  mutate_if(sapply(SHINee_audio_features, is.character), as.factor)
```

<details>
  <summary> *non-tidyverse cleaning* </summary>
```{r}
# Removing duplicates
remove <- c('1 of 1 - The 5th Album', 'Odd - The 4th Album', 'SHINee THE BEST FROM NOW ON', "I’m Your Boy", 'SHINee The 1st Asia Tour Concert \"SHINee World\"')
SHINee_audio_features$remove <- ifelse(SHINee_audio_features$album_name %in% remove, "remove", "keep")
SHINee_audio_features <- SHINee_audio_features[!(SHINee_audio_features$remove=="remove"),]
# Splitting the data set
# Step 1: Identify the Korean, Japanese, and Live albums
korean <- c("'The Story of Light' Epilogue - The 6th Album", '1 and 1 - The 5th Album Repackage', '1 of 1 - The 5th Album', 'Married To The Music - The 4th Album Repackage', 'Odd - The 4th Album', 'Sherlock', "The 3rd Album 'Dream Girl - The Misconceptions of You'", "The 5th Mini Album 'Everybody'")
japanese <- c('Boys Meet U', 'D×D×D', 'FIVE', "I'm Your Boy", 'SHINee THE BEST FROM NOW ON', 'THE FIRST') 
# Step 2: Match the album names and label the respective language
SHINee_audio_features$language <- ifelse(SHINee_audio_features$album_name %in% korean, "korean", 
              ifelse(SHINee_audio_features$album_name %in% japanese, "japanese", "live"))
# Step 3: Split into 3 list by language
languages <- split(SHINee_audio_features,SHINee_audio_features$language)
# Average the Korean albums' features 
kavg <- aggregate(languages$korean[,c(9,10,12,14:19)], list(languages$korean$album_release_year), mean)
names(kavg)[1] <- "year"
kavg$language <- "korean"
# Average the Japanese albums' features
javg <- aggregate(languages$japanese[,c(9,10,12,14:19)], list(languages$japanese$album_release_year), mean)
names(javg)[1] <- "year"
javg$language <- "japanese"
```

#### Data Exploration with Tidyverse {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset.-pills}
***

In this section, examples of tools `ggplot2` offers are demonstrated to show how the right visualization can provide insights on specific research questions. These tools are ranked as basic and advanced visualizations.

##### Basic: Density Plots

*Is there any difference in the features for Korean and Japanese tracks?*

A density plot visualizes the distribution of data over a continuous interval or time period. This chart is a variation of a Histogram that uses kernel smoothing to plot values, allowing for smoother distributions by smoothing out the noise. The peaks of a Density Plot help display where values are concentrated over the interval. An advantage Density Plots have over Histograms is that they're better at determining the distribution shape because they're not affected by the number of bins used. Therefore, `ggplot2::geom_density` is used to compute and draw the kernel density estimate. Tip: One way to make a density easier to see is to stack the densities on top of each other using `position = "stack"` in `geom_density`.

> ggplot2: Density Plots
```{r eval=FALSE}
# Even though the data was initially split, we can easily join them again using 
# Tidyverse: dplyr::full_join return all rows and all columns from both x and y
kjfeatures <- full_join(kavg,javg)
# The first density plot
p1 <- ggplot(kjfeatures, aes(x = loudness, fill = language)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.4) +  theme(legend.justification = c(0,1), legend.position = c(0,1), plot.title = element_text(color = "red", size = 14, face = "bold.italic"))
# The following density plots
p2 <- ggplot(kjfeatures, aes(x = energy, fill = language)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.4, show.legend = FALSE) 
p3 <- ggplot(kjfeatures, aes(x = speechiness, fill = language)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.4, show.legend = FALSE) 
p4 <- ggplot(kjfeatures, aes(x = acousticness, fill = language)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.4, show.legend = FALSE) 
p5 <- ggplot(kjfeatures, aes(x = tempo, fill = language)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.4, show.legend = FALSE) 
p6 <- ggplot(kjfeatures, aes(x = liveness, fill = language)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.4, show.legend = FALSE) 
p7 <- ggplot(kjfeatures, aes(x = valence, fill = language)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.4, show.legend = FALSE) 
p8 <- ggplot(kjfeatures, aes(x = danceability, fill = language)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.4, show.legend = FALSE) 
# A grid to plot all 8 plots neatly
gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1,p2,p3,p4,layout_matrix = rbind(c(0,1),c(2,3)))
gridExtra::grid.arrange(p5,p6,p7,p8,layout_matrix = rbind(c(0,1),c(2,3)))
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
kjfeatures <- full_join(kavg,javg)
p1 <- ggplot(kjfeatures, aes(x = loudness, fill = language)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.4) +  theme(legend.justification = c(0,1), legend.position = c(0,1), plot.title = element_text(color = "red", size = 14, face = "bold.italic"))
p2 <- ggplot(kjfeatures, aes(x = energy, fill = language)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.4, show.legend = FALSE) 
p3 <- ggplot(kjfeatures, aes(x = speechiness, fill = language)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.4, show.legend = FALSE) 
p4 <- ggplot(kjfeatures, aes(x = acousticness, fill = language)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.4, show.legend = FALSE) 
p5 <- ggplot(kjfeatures, aes(x = tempo, fill = language)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.4, show.legend = FALSE) 
p6 <- ggplot(kjfeatures, aes(x = liveness, fill = language)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.4, show.legend = FALSE) 
p7 <- ggplot(kjfeatures, aes(x = valence, fill = language)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.4, show.legend = FALSE) 
p8 <- ggplot(kjfeatures, aes(x = danceability, fill = language)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.4, show.legend = FALSE) 
gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1,p2,p3,p4,layout_matrix = rbind(c(0,1),c(2,3)))
gridExtra::grid.arrange(p5,p6,p7,p8,layout_matrix = rbind(c(0,1),c(2,3)))
```

With these plots, the difference in distribution can be observed for both languages. It is apparent that a Japanese track will have consistently higher energy, lower acousticness, and inconsistent in valence. Whereas, Korean tracks are of a wider range of danceability, which is also apparent in the tempo density plot. Lastly, in spite of the language, both kind of tracks has similar speechiness levels.

***

##### Basic: Line Graphs

*Has their song features differed over the years?*

A line graph is by far the simplest and most powerful tool in `ggplot2`. It is generally used to show changes over time. Line graphs can include a single line for one data set, or multiple lines to compare two or more sets of data.

Firstly, `tidyr::gather` is used to gather columns into rows, the transformation the wide data of average Korean and Japanese features into a long set. This allows graphing of all the features on one plot for easier comparison. 

```{r}
kavg1 <- gather(kavg[,-c(4,10:11)], "features","mean", 2:8)
kavg1$features<-as.factor(kavg1$features)
kavg1$tmean<-scales::rescale(kavg1$mean)
javg1 <- gather(javg[,-c(4,10:11)], "features","mean", 2:8)
javg1$features<-as.factor(javg1$features)
javg1$tmean<-scales::rescale(javg1$mean)
```

Before transformation:

```{r echo=FALSE}
head(kavg)
```

After transformation:
```{r echo=FALSE}
head(kavg1)
```

> ggplot2: Line Graphs
```{r eval=FALSE}
kavg1 %>%
  mutate(label = if_else(year == max(year), as.character(features), NA_character_)) %>% ggplot(aes(y = tmean, x = year, colour = features)) + geom_line(size=1, data = kavg1, stat = "identity") +  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2011,2019,1)) +  labs(x = "Year", y = "Average Value of Feature") + ggtitle("SHINee's Korean musical attributes over the years") +  geom_label_repel(aes(label = label), nudge_x = 1, na.rm = TRUE)
javg1 %>%
  mutate(label = if_else(year == max(year), as.character(features), NA_character_)) %>% ggplot(aes(y = tmean, x = year, colour = features)) + geom_line(size=1, data = javg1, stat = "identity") +   scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2011,2019,1)) +  labs(x = "Year", y = "Average Value of Feature") + ggtitle("SHINee's Japanese musical attributes over the years") +  geom_label_repel(aes(label = label), nudge_x = 1, na.rm = TRUE)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE, fig.align="center" }
kavg1 %>%
  mutate(label = if_else(year == max(year), as.character(features), NA_character_)) %>% ggplot(aes(y = tmean, x = year, colour = features)) + geom_line(size=1, data = kavg1, stat = "identity") +  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2011,2019,1)) +  labs(x = "Year", y = "Average Value of Feature") + ggtitle("SHINee's Korean musical attributes over the years") +  geom_label_repel(aes(label = label), nudge_x = 1, na.rm = TRUE)
javg1 %>%
  mutate(label = if_else(year == max(year), as.character(features), NA_character_)) %>% ggplot(aes(y = tmean, x = year, colour = features)) + geom_line(size=1, data = javg1, stat = "identity") +   scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2011,2019,1)) +  labs(x = "Year", y = "Average Value of Feature") + ggtitle("SHINee's Japanese musical attributes over the years") +  geom_label_repel(aes(label = label), nudge_x = 1, na.rm = TRUE)
```

From the line graph on SHINee's Korean musical attributes, it is apparent that Korean tracks have reduced tremendously in energy and valence from 2013 to 2016 before picking up again. Moreover, there was very small fluctuation in danceability and speechiness over their career. Conversely, from the line graph on SHINee's Japanese musical attributes, it is apparent that Japanese tracks have steadily reduced in valence and acousticness since 2013-2014. Liveness began increasing again in 2015 after it's reduction over the previous two years. Moreover, there was only a very small fluctuation in speechiness over their career, similar to their Korean tracks.

##### Advanced: Dendrogram

*Which albums sound alike?*

A dendrogram is a diagram that shows the hierarchical relationship between objects. The main use of a dendrogram is to work out the best way to allocate objects to clusters. It is most commonly created as an output from hierarchical clustering. For unknown reasons, the `ggplot2` have no functions to plot dendrograms. Fortunately, the ad-hoc package `ggdendro` for `ggplot2` offers a decent, limited solution.

Firstly, the data is transformed using `tidyverse::dplyr` to before a hierarchical clustering can be so as to find the reduced the sum of squared distances of each feature from the average observation in a cluster. That is, for each album, the average is taken of their features which are multiplied by the track duration and then divided by the number of tracks on an album.

```{r}
SHINeeCluster <- SHINee_audio_features %>%
  group_by(album_name) %>%
  summarise(danceability = sum(danceability*duration_ms)/length(album_name),
            energy = sum(energy*duration_ms)/length(album_name),
            loudness = sum(loudness*duration_ms)/length(album_name),
            speechiness = sum(speechiness*duration_ms)/length(album_name),
            acousticness = sum(acousticness*duration_ms)/length(album_name),
            instrumentalness = sum(instrumentalness*duration_ms)/length(album_name),
            liveness = sum(liveness*duration_ms)/length(album_name),
            valence = sum(valence*duration_ms)/length(album_name),
            tempo = sum(tempo*duration_ms)/length(album_name)) %>%
  remove_rownames() %>%
  column_to_rownames("album_name")
SHINee.hc <- hclust(dist(scale(SHINeeCluster)), method = "complete")
```

> ggplot2 - ggdendro: Dendrogram
```{r}
ggdendrogram(SHINee.hc, rotate = TRUE, theme_dendro = FALSE)
```

As a fan, I am able to see, or literally hear, how these distinct clusters were formed. The dendrogram depicts five clusters in which I can see the following pattern:

* Cluster 1: Live Concerts, suggesting SHINee's live shows bring the same musical features and experiences. 

* Cluster 2: Peak Time, I personally believe SHINee hit a peak moment in their career with their Korean album *Everybody*, and Japanese album *Boys Meet U*.

* Cluster 3: SHINee's Brand, the main branch shows albums that have a mix of different mood features from high danceability tracks to low energy. Additionally, the mini-branches also suggest insightful patterns which can be heard which I will not discuss. 

* Cluster 4: The Story of Light stands alone in its own cluster. This album was released after the passing of one of SHINee's vocalists, [Kim Jonghyun](http://jonghyun.smtown.com/Intro) which may have influenced its features. Even though it's a single cluster, it is a part of the *SHINee Brand* larger branch, suggesting it still bears reminiscence of their past albums, preserving their distinct style of music.

* Cluster 5: 1 and 1 also stands alone as its features are related to a 90s retro genre which is different from what SHINee has ever produced. 

***

##### Advanced: Radar Plot

*How to visualize what the features of each cluster look like? Likewise, for the different album types?*

This is called a radar plot. It is a graphical method of displaying multivariate data in the form of a two-dimensional chart of three or more quantitative variables represented on axes starting from the same point. The method to create with `ggplot2` requires a bit of work whereas there are other methods such as `fmsb::radarchart` which allows for easy execution. Nonetheless, in the radar plot below, created using `ggplot2`, it highlights the differences in features for each cluster and the features for SHINee's album types.

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, this Tidyverse recipe demonstrated how to utilize `ggplot2` to create informative visualizations that can convey concepts quickly and in an easily understandable way. Data visualization is considered a tool that can bridge the communication gap between a domain and its audience. This recipe demonstrated how it can help identify areas that need attention or improvement, how it enables clarification of factors influencing attributes, and this will further allow better understandings of how things have been and will become based on the visualizations of trends.
